# TKNP App

[![License: GPL-3.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL3.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE.md)

The TKNP app provides convenient access to important information and personalized services in the palm of your hand. It was designed to run smoothly & easily to facilitate
e-learning, which has become an essential system in education. This app comes with the most services that
the student needs during his study period. I look forward to adding new services that are in the interest of the student in particular.
